st.markdown("""
*   **Model's Nature:** VAEs learn to create "average" versions of digits. This often results in blurry outputs, especially with low-resolution (8x8) images.
*   **Wrong Coordinates:** The previous version of the app used a hard-coded map of coordinates for each digit. That map was a guess and did not match how **your specific model** learned to organize digits. This explorer tool lets you find the correct coordinates for your model.
*   **No Post-Processing:** The model outputs shades of gray. By adding a **threshold**, we force every pixel to be either pure black or white, creating a much sharper final image.
